439 Communication Protocol
To ensure consistency in communication, we have designed the following specifications for communication codes.

This is an example of the concatenated message sting the home base will look for. Each field is delimited by a tab character. The message ending is signaled by a newline character.
`String msg = site_name + "\t" + msg_code + "\t" + param_1 + "\n";`

The following fields are mandatory:

- `site_name`: string—the remote site name
- `msg_code`: integer—see code listings below

Any response can have as many optional parameter fields after the required fields as needed. These parameter fields ought to add additional information related to the status code. Each unique status code should have its parameters defined below.
